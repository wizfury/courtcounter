# courtcounter

This App is designed to help count the score in the game of baskteball. In a Basketball match, when a team hits a 3 pointer u press +3 points button to increase the score of that team by 3 points.
This too works for the app when a team scores a 2 pointer or a free throw. when the match is over, there is a requirement to reset the scores. Press the reset button to reset the score back to zeros for both the teams✌️.
